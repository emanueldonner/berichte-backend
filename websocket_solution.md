Yes, I can help you with that.

To achieve this, you can use WebSocket to establish a real-time connection between the backend and the frontend. This will allow you to send the logs from the backend to the frontend as soon as they happen.

Here's an example of how you can implement this in your Fastify backend:

```JavaScript
const fastify = require('fastify')();
const WebSocket = require('ws');

// Create a WebSocket server and listen for connections
const wss = new WebSocket.Server({ port: 8080 });

// Set up a route to handle logging
fastify.get('/logs', (request, reply) => {
  // Get the WebSocket connection for this request
  const ws = request.websocket();

  // Listen for new logs and send them to the frontend
  const logger = (message) => {
    ws.send(message);
  };

  // Attach the logger to the Fastify instance
  fastify.log.info = logger;
  fastify.log.warn = logger;
  fastify.log.error = logger;
});

// Start the server
fastify.listen(3000, (err, address) => {
  if (err) {
    fastify.log.error(err);
    process.exit(1);
  }
  fastify.log.info(`Server listening on ${address}`);
});
```

In this example, we create a WebSocket server and listen for connections on port 8080. We also set up a route for handling logging requests, which returns a WebSocket connection. We then attach the logger function to the Fastify instance and send any log messages to the frontend via the WebSocket connection.

On the frontend, you can use the WebSocket API to establish a connection to the backend and receive log messages in real-time. Here's how you can do it in a React component:

```JavaScript
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function LogViewer() {
  const [logs, setLogs] = useState([]);

  useEffect(() => {
    // Create a WebSocket connection
    const ws = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:8080/logs');

    // Listen for incoming messages
    ws.addEventListener('message', (event) => {
      const message = event.data;
      setLogs((prevLogs) => [...prevLogs, message]);
    });

    // Clean up the WebSocket connection on unmount
    return () => {
      ws.close();
    };
  }, []);

  return (
    <div>
      {logs.map((log, index) => (
        <p key={index}>{log}</p>
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}
```

In this React component, we establish a WebSocket connection to the backend and listen for incoming log messages. When a new message arrives, we add it to the `logs` state using the `setLogs` function. We also clean up the WebSocket connection on unmount using the `useEffect` hook.

With these two pieces of code in place, you should now be able to see your logs in real-time on the frontend as soon as they happen on the backend.
